# Smart Quiz Application  

##  Overview  
Smart Quiz is a simple but fun web-based quiz application built using **Python (Django)**.  
The main idea behind this project is to create an interactive platform where users can attempt quizzes, check their knowledge, and get instant results.  

We wanted to keep the project lightweight, user-friendly, and easy to extend in the future (like adding more categories, leaderboards, etc.).
